System Specification: “Structured Chess Thought Analyzer”
Overview
A Python program that takes a PGN file and analyzes each move of a chess game using your structured five-step thought process:

Orient

Direction

Candidates

Calculation

Blunder Check

Main Components
1. PGN Parser
Input: .pgn file

Output: list of (position, move) tuples

2. Thought Process Engine
For each move:

Input: current board, move, player_color

Output: structured analysis dictionary per step

Step-by-Step Operationalization
Step 1: ORIENT
Goal: Identify key static elements of the position

Substeps
Kings:

Are there any open files/ranks/diagonals leading to the king?

Are there any possible checks?

Things:

List all loose, hanging, overloaded, or weak pieces/pawns

Strings:

Detect alignments for pins, skewers, and discovered attacks

def orient(board, color):
    data = {}

    # 1. King Safety
    king_square = board.king(color)
    data['king_exposed'] = is_king_exposed(board, king_square)
    data['checks_available'] = get_possible_checks(board, not color)

    # 2. Hanging & Weak Pieces
    data['hanging_pieces'] = find_hanging_pieces(board, color)
    data['weak_pawns'] = find_weak_pawns(board, color)
    data['overloaded'] = find_overloaded_defenders(board, color)

    # 3. Strings (pins, discoveries)
    data['pins'] = find_pins(board, color)
    data['discovered_attack_lines'] = find_discoveries(board, color)

    return data
Step 2: SELECT DIRECTION
Goal: Determine what kind of plan to pursue

Substeps
Detect immediate threats (opponent’s last move)

Determine phase of game (opening, middlegame, endgame)

Choose plan based on:

Material situation

Threats

Game phase (e.g., castle, attack, defend, promote)

Pseudo-Code
python
Copy
Edit
def select_direction(board, color, last_move, move_number):
    phase = get_game_phase(board)
    is_threat = move_creates_threat(board, last_move, not color)

    if is_threat:
        responses = generate_threat_responses(board, color)
        return {'phase': phase, 'threat_response': responses}

    else:
        plan = suggest_plan(board, color, phase)
        return {'phase': phase, 'strategic_plan': plan}
Step 3: GENERATE CANDIDATES
Goal: List plausible moves based on Orientation + Direction

Substeps
Filter legal moves based on:

Addressing threats

Aligning with strategic plan

Avoiding tactical blunders

Pseudo-Code
python
Copy
Edit
def generate_candidates(board, color, direction_data):
    legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves)
    candidates = []

    for move in legal_moves:
        if move_fits_plan(board, move, direction_data):
            candidates.append(move)

    return candidates
Step 4: CALCULATE
Goal: Evaluate top candidate lines using engine

Substeps
For each candidate:

Evaluate best line (e.g., 3–5 ply)

Score and annotate threats, gains, positional shifts

Pseudo-Code
python
Copy
Edit
def calculate(board, candidates, engine):
    evaluations = []

    for move in candidates:
        board.push(move)
        score = engine.analyse(board, chess.engine.Limit(depth=10))['score']
        board.pop()

        evaluations.append({'move': move, 'score': score})

    evaluations.sort(key=lambda x: -x['score'].relative.score())  # best first
    return evaluations
Step 5: BLUNDER CHECK
Goal: Quick scan for opponent’s best replies

Substeps
Evaluate top 1–2 engine replies to selected move

Highlight any large eval swings (potential blunders)

Pseudo-Code
python
Copy
Edit
def blunder_check(board, selected_move, engine):
    board.push(selected_move)
    top_lines = engine.analyse(board, chess.engine.Limit(depth=10), multipv=2)
    board.pop()

    responses = [line['pv'][0] for line in top_lines]
    return responses
Main Execution Loop
python
Copy

def analyze_game(pgn_path):
    game = load_pgn(pgn_path)
    board = chess.Board()
    engine = load_stockfish_engine()

    for move_number, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves(), 1):
        color = board.turn
        orient_data = orient(board, color)
        last_move = move if move_number > 1 else None
        direction_data = select_direction(board, color, last_move, move_number)
        candidates = generate_candidates(board, color, direction_data)
        evaluations = calculate(board, candidates, engine)
        best_move = evaluations[0]['move']
        blunder_responses = blunder_check(board, best_move, engine)

        display_thought_process(board, move, {
            'orient': orient_data,
            'direction': direction_data,
            'candidates': candidates,
            'evaluations': evaluations,
            'blunder_check': blunder_responses
        })

        board.push(move)
